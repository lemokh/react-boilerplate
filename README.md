# ReactJS server-side boilerplate
I love how React allows you render apps on the server and have the client take on from where the server left it.
My goal for this project is to have a lean boilerplate so I can use it to start my next ReactJS apps.

## Tech stack

This project relies on the following technologies:
- [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [react-route](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
- [node-jsx](https://github.com/petehunt/node-jsx)
- [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express)  
- [ejs](https://github.com/tj/ejs)


## How to get started
1. You will need `bower` install globally before starting: `npm install bower -g`

2. Clone this repo, `cd` into the repo directory and run: `npm install && bower install`

3. Run `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` on your browser

_Attention: this project will use your default `process.env.PORT` and will fall back to port `8080` in case it is not set._

### Suggestions?
Do you have any suggestions on how this project could be better?
